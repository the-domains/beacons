One of our favorite buildings in the entire district is 79 Broad St.  It's coloqually called the Eye Care Building because, well it has a big sign on it that says eye care.  The interior and exterior are gorgeous and it has an empty lot next to it that would be great outdoor space.  The building is currently under contract by a BEACONS friendly buyer and we hope to make it available to Beacons members soon.
