We came across a gorgeous space last week and wanted to show BEACONS list members first. It's located in the Heart of South Downtown on the 2nd floor of the historic Rich's department store building.  The building is home to Creative Loafing, C4, the Center for Civic Innovation, Iron Yards coding academy and many other creative entities.  You'll be in good company here for sure! The space is 1500 square feet and costs $2,520 per month including all utilities.
