The street level space between Taj perfumes and the dental center is available for a creative who doesn't mind doing renovations. It's the space with the white gate in the photo. The space certainly needs quite a lot of sweat put into it but the owner, Mr. Shakoor, is willing to reward the hardwork with reduced rent. It has the potential for light retail and a work studio. This space has the added potential of turning the upstairs into a living space.  The space is about 1,000 sqft and the asking price is $1,200 / month.
