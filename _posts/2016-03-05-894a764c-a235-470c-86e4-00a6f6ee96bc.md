The Yellow Submarine. This little storefront on Broad St. used to be a bodega. Sadly, it's been vacant for quite some time. The previous owners didn't want to lease it to anyone so BEACONS found an investor to buy it.  The new owner wants to lease it to a few Beacons members.  We're currently showing the space to interested parties.  It's around 3000 sqft with a little kitchen in the back.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/db6ddb84-fc08-4c00-abba-4fb28f0dc8dd.png)
