COMING SOOOOOON!  

BEACONS is teaming up with the folks over at M. Rich to make the street level space at the historic Riches building available to BEACONS members.  The space is beautiful but in dissaray.  We've already got some leads on entities who could take up large footprints but need many more to make this space a busy and vibrant space for creatives.  Let us know if you're interested and we'll gladly show you the space.
