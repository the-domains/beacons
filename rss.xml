            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Broad St. Storefront</h1><p>The street level space between Taj perfumes and the dental center is available for a creative who doesn't mind doing renovations. It's the space with the white gate in the photo. The space certainly needs quite a lot of sweat put into it but the owner, Mr. Shakoor, is willing to reward the hardwork with reduced rent. It has the potential for light retail and a work studio. This space has the added potential of turning the upstairs into a living space.  The space is about 1,000 sqft and the asking price is $1,200 / month.   </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/76b16e4b7751b6522e95f1c9961a0ee15563d366.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Available studio in M. Rich</h1><p>

We came across a gorgeous space last week and wanted to show BEACONS list members first. It's located in the Heart of South Downtown on the 2nd floor of the historic Rich's department store building.  The building is home to Creative Loafing, C4, the Center for Civic Innovation, Iron Yards coding academy and many other creative entities.  You'll be in good company here for sure! The space is 1500 square feet and costs $2,520 per month including all utilities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/14d3c74fd39b3576e8e7d3a316884085e3b1f35a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
