            <title><![CDATA[Yellow Submarine AVAILABLE!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Yellow Submarine AVAILABLE!</h1><p>The Yellow Submarine. This little storefront on Broad St. used to be a bodega. Sadly, it's been vacant for quite some time. The previous owners didn't want to lease it to anyone so BEACONS found an investor to buy it.  The new owner wants to lease it to a few Beacons members.  We're currently showing the space to interested parties.  It's around 3000 sqft with a little kitchen in the back.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e299b4d0917bf3be025dd7e9424685b5da0f0107.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Eyecare Bldg ALMOST!]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Eyecare Bldg ALMOST!</h1><p>One of our favorite buildings in the entire district is 79 Broad St.  It's coloqually called the Eye Care Building because, well it has a big sign on it that says eye care.  The interior and exterior are gorgeous and it has an empty lot next to it that would be great outdoor space.  The building is currently under contract by a BEACONS friendly buyer and we hope to make it available to Beacons members soon.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c8cd86e16469f88006a9d46d2f860c5489a20daa.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Broad St. Storefront]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Broad St. Storefront</h1><p>The street level space between Taj perfumes and the dental center is available for a creative who doesn't mind doing renovations. It's the space with the white gate in the photo. The space certainly needs quite a lot of sweat put into it but the owner, Mr. Shakoor, is willing to reward the hardwork with reduced rent. It has the potential for light retail and a work studio. This space has the added potential of turning the upstairs into a living space.  The space is about 1,000 sqft and the asking price is $1,200 / month.   </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/76b16e4b7751b6522e95f1c9961a0ee15563d366.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Creative Studio Available]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Creative Studio Available</h1><p>

We came across a gorgeous space last week and wanted to show BEACONS list members first. It's located in the Heart of South Downtown on the 2nd floor of the historic Rich's department store building.  The building is home to Creative Loafing, C4, the Center for Civic Innovation, Iron Yards coding academy and many other creative entities.  You'll be in good company here for sure! The space is 1500 square feet and costs $2,520 per month including all utilities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/14d3c74fd39b3576e8e7d3a316884085e3b1f35a.jpg"></article>]]></description>
